# Cooling Oceans Did Trigger Ordovician Biodiversification (Ontiveros et al., in revision)

## Requirements

The code needs at least MATLAB 2020 a. to be active. The Mapping Toolbox is needed to produce the maps. 

The main code is found on "main.mat, and produces the four main figures : 
- the biodiversity curve
- the biodiversity maps
- the Latitudinal Gradient
- the Regional Curves

It is possible to chose some of the inputs, such as the paleoclimatic scenario used (Song or Goldberg),
to account the seasonality, to display the results of a detrended paleoclimatic scenario (at 12 PAL)

The code also compares our simulated diversity to some fossil groups in the paleocontinents of Laurentia, Baltica,
Sibera and South China. It is possible to compare brachiopods (input 'bra'), trilobites ('tri'), conodonts ('con')
or the global marine fauna ('mar').
